## Task: Build the Right Column

Create the right column of the design. There is a `styles` folder with lots of CSS already created. There's a `components` folder with several files already created that are ready for you to use.

1. For the top part of the sidebar, use the `_user-snapshot.scss` file and a similar class name. For the avatar, there's already an `_avatar.scss` file for you with the appropriate color gradient. You'll need to finish adding CSS to these files to achieve the design.

2. For the UI in the middle of the `aside`, use anchors since these would navigate the user somewhere. You'll probably need to make the anchors `block` as a starting point so they stack on top of each other. You should also try to see if you can adapt the existing `.card` component (`_card.scss`) for the anchors. The background color is a little darker than the normal card background, so make a "variation" of the card with this background: `#bdccd747`.

Here are the URL's for the SVG icons that already exist:

- /images/user.svg
- /images/up-down
- /images/plane.svg
- /images/briefcase.svg

3. For the last "card" in the `aside`, you can use this emoji: ü§òüèº
