## Task: Use absolute positioning to make a credit card UI

- You'll need to start by putting `position: relative` on the container.
- Absolute-position the inner parts of the credit card to make it look like the `final.png` graphic
- Use media queries to make the card have a small, medium, and large size based on the screen being:
  - Less than `800px`
  - Between `800px` and `1100px`
  - Over `1100px`
