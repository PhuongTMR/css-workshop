## Examples

1. Build a form input that uses absolute positioned icon (like a search input) and then `:focus-within` to manage the focus look

2. Build a layout using position absolute for a fixed header and footer. Make the content in the middle span the distance between the header and footer and show the issues that arise.

3. Demonstrate various centering needs and the different ways to center

- `margin: 0 auto`
- `margin: auto`
- Absolute positioning and transforms to center (unknown width)
- Negative margins (known width lightboxes)
